## Automatic Question Answering

I used Questin-Answering-Dataset from Kaggle that's link is https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/questionanswer-dataset 

### What I did :-
1. All the file was in txt format. I read those file as csv format.
2. I took only three columns those are necessary for my project and that are Title, Question and Answer. 
3. I added Title and Question Column Together, to get the persons's name.
4. Dropped the duplicate question.
5. To get word I used word_tokenize.
6. Cleaned word like removing punctuation.
7.
8.
